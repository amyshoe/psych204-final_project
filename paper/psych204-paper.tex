\begin{abstract}
The abstract should be one paragraph, indented 1/8~inch on both sides,
in 9~point font with single spacing. The heading ``{\bf Abstract}''
should be 10~point, bold, centered, with one line of space below
it. This one-paragraph abstract section is required only for standard
six page proceedings papers. Following the abstract should be a blank
line, followed by the header ``{\bf Keywords:}'' and a list of
descriptive keywords separated by semicolons, all in 9~point font, as
shown below.

\textbf{Keywords:}

\section{Introduction}

Content-wise, here we have two identical problems:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(A)] Solve for $x$:\\ $x * 6 + 66 = 81.9$

\item[(B)] When Ted got home from his waiter job, he multiplied his hourly wage by the 6hr he worked that day. Then he added the \$66.00 he made in tips and found he had earned \$81.90. How much does Ted make per hour?
\end{enumerate}

Though questions (A) and (B) present the same information, much can be said about how the presentations of these two problems affect how students and teachers diagnose their respective difficulty level, and therefore how likely they are to reach the correct answer. When asked which format best facilitates acquisition of algebraic concepts, for example, teachers agree that the first of the two problems above will do so better than the story problem because symbolic problems are inherently easier, and therefore ought to be taught first in an introductory algebra class (\textbf{citation}). The present paper takes a study conducted by Nathan and Koedinger (\textbf{citation}) that shines a light on situations where story problems are actually \textit{easier} than symbolic problems, and using a probabilistic programming language, seeks to understand the cognitive mechanisms that bring forth the patterns they noticed. As such, the authors hope to bring further light into the psychology of math students and assess how pedagogical methods reflecting the insights discussed in this paper can better attend to their needs.


\subsection{Questioning Formalism First}

It is widely believed among mathematics teachers that symbolic representations of algebra problems are easier than story problems testing the same information and thus should be introduced first [CITE a bunch of the dudes nathan cites in that first paper we read]. Indeed, problems expressed in symbolic notation are comprised of more easily manipulable components than verbal problems, as all the relevant parts of the problem are present in the symbols and students do not have to identify the key parts of the problem from within a story context. On the other hand, verbal problems can ground the scenario in a more relatable, real-life manner, which may heighten studentsâ€™ intuition or provide insight into what problem-solving strategy to use. Though surveys in \citeA{Nathan2012} show that teachers think symbolic problems are likely to be solved correctly, \citeA{KoedNath2004} show a disparity in the teachers' beliefs and students' performance, as students in their study show a higher rate of success for verbal problems.

\citeA{KoedNath2004} propose what they call the \textit{verbal hypothesis}, which states that the earlier acquisition of language gives students an advantage on comprehending and thus solving story problems over symbolic problems. 

While \citeA{KoedNath2004} show that the difference in levels success students have with story problems versus equation problems is largely due to the strategies most common for each type of problem and the success rates of those strategies, they only hint at theories of why some strategies are more successful than others and they provide no discussion of how students choose what strategy to use for a given problem.

\subsection{Second Level Headings}

Second level headings should be 11~point, initial caps, bold, and
flush left. Leave one line space above the heading and 1/4~line
space below the heading.

Third level headings should be 10~point, initial caps, bold, and flush
left. Leave one line space above the heading, but no space after the
heading.


\section{Discussion}

Use standard APA citation format. Citations within the text should
include the author's last name and year. If the authors' names are
included in the sentence, place only the year in parentheses, as in
\citeA{Nathan2012}, but otherwise place the entire reference in
parentheses with the authors and year separated by a comma
\cite{Nathan2012}. List multiple references alphabetically and
separate them by semicolons
\cite{Nathan2012,KoedNath2004}. Use the
``et~al.'' construction only after listing all the authors to a
publication in an earlier reference and for citations with four or
more authors.

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
footnote.} in the text. Place the footnotes in 9~point type at the
bottom of the column on which they appear. Precede the footnote block
with a horizontal rule.\footnote{Sample of the second footnote.}

Number tables consecutively. Place the table number and title (in
10~point) above the table with one line space above the caption and
one line space below it, as in Table~\ref{sample-table}. You may float
tables to the top or bottom of a column, or set wide tables across
both columns.

\begin{table}[!ht]
\begin{center} 
\caption{Sample table title.} 
\label{sample-table} 
\vskip 0.12in
\begin{tabular}{ll} 
\hline
Error type    &  Example \\
\hline
Take smaller        &   63 - 44 = 21 \\
Always borrow~~~~   &   96 - 42 = 34 \\
0 - N = N           &   70 - 47 = 37 \\
0 - N = 0           &   70 - 47 = 30 \\
\hline
\end{tabular} 
\end{center} 
\end{table}


\subsection{Figures}

All artwork must be very dark for purposes of reproduction and should
not be hand drawn. Number figures sequentially, placing the figure
number and caption, in 10~point, after the figure with one line space
above the caption and one line space below it, as in
Figure~\ref{sample-figure}. If necessary, leave extra white space at
the bottom of the page to avoid splitting the figure and figure
caption. You may float figures to the top or bottom of a column, or
set wide figures across both columns.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\fbox{CoGNiTiVe ScIeNcE}
\end{center}
\caption{This is a figure.}
